Fin. (codenamed cs2103-sunset)
==============================

A blast from the past! Work that was done in our module CS2103.

### Snarky Description ###
ToDo managers are often featureful but clunky and inefficient to use. Fin.
focuses on what's relevant and squares away everything else. As geeks ourselves
we enjoy the speed at which we can organize our life around command-line
applications and we hope we are able to bring this speed and joy to our users.
To Fin., managing your task is important, but finishing them is even more #impt.
